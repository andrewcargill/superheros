# Hero Chat
Hero Chat is a fantasy based website where 'want-to-be' superheros can socialize and share posts about their amazing world-saving adventures. This is the first build / release and lays the foundations of a world that will be expanded to include other user types such as 'City Mayors' and 'Fans' that will be able to interact, chat and reward Superheros.

The context is that the 'World Government Agency' has hidden a top-secret website deep in the internet. This location is only known by the worlds Superheros. 

Once inside the Comic-book styled environment takes over and makes for a fun place where these saviours of the world can hang-out and unwind.

## Project Goals
A react frontend website and django backend API. Linked together to provide full CRUD functionality. 

A site that is accessed via login and provides users with the features of creating posts and comments and editing their profile and superpowers. 

### The factors in setting these goals:
- Project submission deadline (Production time of 2 weeks).
- Entry level knowledge and understanding of creating a React frontend and API backend.
- This project fell over the Christmas and New Year period so there was very limited access to Mentor and tutor support. 

### Project goals:

|No.|Goal|Description|
|---|---|---|
|1|Log in/log out/Sign up | User can create an account and login or log out|
|2|Posts page styled with SuperHero theme | A responsive homepage with post CRUD functionality|
|3|Comments | Comments for each post with CRUD functionality|
|4|Profiles (Created on new account) | Profiles with full CRUD Functionality |
|5|Powers (Created on new account) | Powers for each User with full CRUD Functionality |
|6| Powers search and rating | Powers can be searched via a drop down menu |
|7| Site styled in strong comic-book styling | A design theme that runs consistently across the site |
|8| Front-end react website and custom built API| Hosted on Heroku |
|9| Deployment of final website to Heroku | Upon project completion | 
|10| Document all known bugs and issues | Ensure documentation is clear and honest |

## UX Design
### Working within the limitations
Due to how the course has been structured I had two weeks to create a project that met the Code Institute pass requirements for this module. This was two weeks over the Christmas and New Year period. This shaped my thinking from the beginning, I needed to keep my goals and ambitions realistic or risk not having a project to submit on the deadline date.

I had not worked with React before and had limited knowledge of creating a Django API that linked to a React repository. Time would need to be allocated to ensure this basic function, of the backend talking to the frontend, worked well.

I knew that Bootstrap would be useful as a framework for styling this project, but I did not want to lean it's default styling too much. My thoughts were to utilize Bootstrap for flex styling and add custom CSS for the general styling of the site.

The information above formed the hard-lines around my thinking going into the UX Design process. This needed to be a simple site with a strong design and basic functionality. A project that could be expanded on in the future so that the site could develop into a strong portfolio project. 

### Why SuperHeros?
I knew it was going to be a basic post, comments and profile react website, but I did not want to create a generic social media site. This theme enabled me to show a different design style from my pervious portfolio projects.


### Research
Looking at the style of classic superhero comics I saw that they had a lot of energy. Through the fonts and the language a strong and positive emotion is projected to the readers. 

![project brainstorm](../superheros/src/assets/readme/readme_brainstorm.jpg)

### Mock ups
In Adobe XD I created some wire frames and explored the functionality of the website. I planned out the site in detail and also planned the CSS containers and fonts. This planning really saved me time during the main production stage of the project as I was able to focus on the functional coding and not be distracted by responsive design and styling problems/ challenges.

![wire frames](../superheros/src/assets/readme/readme_wireframe.jpg)

### Colors

|Color|Main use within the site|
|---|---|
|![#FFFC00](https://placehold.co/15x15/FFFC00/FFFC00.png) `#FFFC00`| Background of site
| ![#000000](https://placehold.co/15x15/000000/000000.png) `#000000` | Text and borders
| ![#FFFFFF](https://placehold.co/15x15/FFFFFF/FFFFFF.png) `#FFFFFF` | Container backgrounds and input fields
| ![#4AF626](https://placehold.co/15x15/4AF626/4AF626.png) `#4AF626` | Terminal text

### Fonts

|[font-family: courier-std, monospace;](https://github.com/andrewcargill/superheros/blob/23969f79fd8e7012b0bf0574c454119024858f7b/src/App.module.css#L35)|Terminal: Used on the landing page and powers edit view. This is the cold voice of 'authority' |



### Tables and Databases
![wire frames](../superheros/src/assets/readme/readme_models.jpg)

## Development


### Diagrams to implementation 
This is how the planned site evolved into the developed site.
Time was on my mind throughout the sites development, with design and functionality choices and sacrifices constantly being made, in an agile fashion, to ensure the project stayed on track and that a finished site was live by the deadline date.


|Planned|Finished Site|Comment|
|---|---|---|
|Home page has post view and searchable hero powers|Finished site has post view and searchable hero profiles|I switched to the hero search as it was more realistic with the remaining available development time|
|Profile page|Implemented as planned||
|Powers|This was implemented in the API as planned|Added to the profiles for ease of use|
|Creating a post|Implemented as planned||
|General styling|This was followed but evolved through development| I would have liked to have replicated the exact design in the mockups for all components|

### Reuse of components
- The navigation is used throughout the site along with the post, comment, profile and powers components. 
- Loading spinners are imported as a centralized component
- Two main CSS files are reused across the site.
    - App.module.css : Contains all fonts
    - Containers.module.css : Contains all content containers

### Front-End Libraries
The main library used in this site is React. 

Bootstrap 4 was used in combination with custom CSS to provide the styling and overall functionality of the site. 

### User stories and sprints
I implemented user stories for every step of the frontend development of this project. The main project [can be viewed here.](https://github.com/users/andrewcargill/projects/8)

For reference here are the original project goals:

## Testing
Extensive manual testing has been carried out on both the Frontend and Backend elements of this project. Any bugs that were found have been document in the results and are details in the [Bugs section](#bugs) of this documentation.

All Python, Javascript and CSS code has passed code checkers. The Lighthouse scored well - but did highlight some problems with, what seems like, the use of Bootstrap within the site.

## Challenges
- I have never created a project under, what felt like, such a time constant. To complete all the React tutorials and then head into this project with the clock ticking was a big thing to manage. I knew that this was only going to be possible if my time was planned well and if, in my mind, I was able to settle for 80% being fine. This was hard for me as I am naturally driven to do my best and always push to try and achieve great results, but for this project it was about something different. The ability to read the requirements and make a MVP that would pass. 
- Planning the styling of the project during the UX design stage helped me a lot. As mentioned earlier, I planned the CSS and HTML code for styling the site during this stage so that the styling during the actual production of the site was easier and required less decision making.
- At first I created the API without filters and then when I came to building the comments component and trying to link it to the posts, I realized that it was the API that would be doing the filtering (I originally thought that this could be achieved on the front end by just adding some Javascript, but then realized that this was a bad idea. If this was a site with thousands of users it would not be efficient and would make the site extremely slow). 

## Bugs

- #### POST EDIT BUG
    - Sometimes the post edit button takes you back to the home page. I think this could be something connected to the user tokens.
- #### PROFILE EDIT BUG
    - The edit window shows the default image instead of existing image. I think this is a fault in the code and with a little more time I would compare the 'edit post' code against the 'profile edit' code and see what track down the problem.  
    - Sometimes when going to edit the profile you are returned to Post view. This is a bug I have not been able to track down at the time of submission. 
- #### USER LOGGED OUT AFTER A SHORT TIME
    - This is connected to the user tokens. I believe they are running out and not getting renewed.

- #### IMAGE UPLOAD BUG
    - I spent a lot of time researching this bug. It appears that either Cloudinary or the API prefers .jpg files over .png! After much testing it appears that .jpg files are stable and I cannot get any crashing while using this files format. 
- #### SITE SECURITY
    - Although an un-logged in visitor cannot edit, delete or create anything on the site they can currently access pages on the site using direct URL addresses. This is obviously something that will be addressed before the site is released to the wider public.

## Deployment

Requirements: 
- Cloudinary or similar
- ElephantSQL or similar
- Heroku or similar

This site is deployed via two Heroku apps. One for the API and the other for the front end React site. Getting the two connected can take some time, but below are some guidelines to get you started. 

You will need to set up a Cloudinary account, which will store all of the images for the site

To store the databases will need to create an ElephantSQL account.

The tips below will help you get started, but this will require some prior knowledge in working with React, Databases and API's. I have not covered how to set up a development version of the site and should you require any help setting up this site please do email me and I will be happy to help: andycargill01@aol.com

### API
 - Create a new app in Heroku named 'superhero-api'
 - Within 'Config Var': 
    - Add: ALLOWED_HOST (Add the URL address of the superhero-api)
    - Add: CLIENT_ORIGIN (add the address of the 'front end' Heroku URL)
    - Add: CLOUDINARY_URL (Add the address to your Cloudinary repository)
    - Add: DATABASE_URL (Add the address to your ElephantSQL respository)
    - Add: DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC and the value of '1'
    - Add: SECRET_KEY and set a secret key value

    - Deploy [this repository](https://github.com/andrewcargill/api-superheros) to the 'superhero-api' Heroku app.

### Front End

- Create a new app in Heroku called 'hero-chat'
- Open a copy of this repository and in the file 'src/api/axiosDefaults.js' update the axios.defaults.baseURL to the URL of the deployed API above. 
- Deploy the repository to the created 'hero-chat' Heroku app.

## Future Development
- Users can compare the powers of two superheros (along the line of top trumps)
- City Major login - They can reward superheros with money and also add posts that link to specific Superheros
- General Public login - They can rate superheros and send fan-mail (direct messages to Superheros)
