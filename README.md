# Hero Chat
Hero Chat is a fantasy based website where 'want-to-be' superheros can socialize and share posts about their amazing world-saving adventures. This is the first build / release and lays the foundations of a world that will be expanded to include other user types such as 'City Majors' and 'Fans' that will be able to interact are reward Superheros.

The context is that the 'World Government Agency' has hidden a top-secret website deep in the internet who's location is only known by the worlds Superheros. 

Once inside the Comic-book styled environment makes for a fun place where these saviours of the world can hang-out and unwind. 

## Project Goals
A react frontend website and django backend API. Linked together to provide full CRUD functionality. 

A site that can only be accessed via login and provides users with the features of creating posts, comments and profiles. 

### The factors in setting these goals:
- Project submission deadline (Production time of 2 weeks).
- Entry level knowledge and understanding of creating a React frontend and API backend.
- This project feel over the Christmas and New Year period so there was no access to Mentor support and limited access to tutor support. 

### Project goals:

|No.|Goal|Description|
|---|---|---|
|1|Log in/log out/Sign up | User can create an account and login or log out|
|2|Posts page styled with SuperHero theme | A responsive homepage with post CRUD functionality|
|3|Comments | Comments for each post with CRUD functionality|
|4|Profiles (Created on new account) | Profiles with full CRUD Functionality |
|5|Powers (Created on new account) | Powers for each User with full CRUD Functionality |
|6| Powers search and rating | Powers can be searched via a drop down menu |
|7| Site styled in strong comic-book styling | A design theme that runs consistently across the site |
|8| Front-end react website and custom built API| Hosted on Heroku |
|9| Deployment of final website to Heroku | Upon project completion | 
|10| Document all known bugs and issues | Ensure documentation is clear and honest |

## UX Design
### Working within the limitations
Due to how the course has been structured I had two weeks to create a project that met the Code Institute pass requirements for this module. This was two weeks over the Christmas and New Year period. So I knew I needed to created something realistically achievable within these hard timeline limitations. 

I had not worked with React before and had limited knowledge of creating an Django API that linked to a React repository. Time would need to be allocated to ensure this basic function, of the backend talking to the frontend, worked well.

This formed the hard-lines around my thinking in the UX Design process. This needed to be a simple site with a strong design and basic functionality. Sometime that could be expanded on in the future so that the site could develop into a strong portfolio project. 

### Why SuperHeros?
I knew it was going to be a basic post, comments and profile react website, but I did not want to create a generic social media site. This theme enabled me to show a different design style from my pervious portfolio projects.

### Research
Looking at the style of classic superhero comics I saw that they had a lot of energy. Through the fonts and the language a strong and positive emotion is projected to the readers. 

### Mock ups
In Adobe XD I created some wire frames and explored the functionality of the website.

### Colors

|Color|Main use within the site|
|---|---|
|![#FFFC00](https://placehold.co/15x15/FFFC00/FFFC00.png) `#FFFC00`| Background of site
| ![#000000](https://placehold.co/15x15/000000/000000.png) `#000000` | Text and borders
| ![#FFFFFF](https://placehold.co/15x15/FFFFFF/FFFFFF.png) `#FFFFFF` | Container backgrounds and input fields
| ![#4AF626](https://placehold.co/15x15/4AF626/4AF626.png) `#4AF626` | Terminal text

### Fonts
|Font|Main uses within the site|
|---|---|
|[font-family: grenadine-mvb, sans-serif;](https://github.com/andrewcargill/superheros/blob/23969f79fd8e7012b0bf0574c454119024858f7b/src/App.module.css#L2)| Informational text - This is a more formal font that is easy to read.|
|[font-family: cc-smash-open, sans-serif;](https://github.com/andrewcargill/superheros/blob/23969f79fd8e7012b0bf0574c454119024858f7b/src/App.module.css#L27)|Superhero usernames. There is a lot of movement and drama in this font.|
|[font-family: collector-comic, sans-serif;](https://github.com/andrewcargill/superheros/blob/23969f79fd8e7012b0bf0574c454119024858f7b/src/App.module.css#L15)|Headlines and captions. This font replicates the fonts used in comic books. It is fun and dramatic with a sense of movement and energy|
|[font-family: courier-std, monospace;](https://github.com/andrewcargill/superheros/blob/23969f79fd8e7012b0bf0574c454119024858f7b/src/App.module.css#L35)|Terminal: Used on the landing page and powers edit view. This is the cold voice of 'authority' |

### Tables and Databases

### Diagrams to implementation 
This is how the planned site evolved into the developed site.
Time was on my mind throughout the sites development, with design and functionality choices and sacrifices constantly being made, to ensure the project stayed on track and that a finished site was live by the deadline date.

|Planned|Finished Site|Comment|
|---|---|---|
|Home page has post view and searchable hero powers|Finished site has post view and searchable hero profiles|I switched to the hero search as it was more realistic with the remaining available development time|
|Profile page|Implemented as planned||
|Powers|This was implemented in the API as planned|Added to the profiles for ease of use|
|Creating a post|Implemented as planned||
|General styling|This was followed but evolved through development| I would have liked to have replicated the exact design in the mockups for all components|
## Development
### Reuse of components
- The navigation is used throughout the site along with the post, comment, profile and powers components. 
- Loading spinners are imported as a centralized component
- Two main CSS files are reused across the site.
    - App.module.css : Contains all fonts
    - Containers.module.css : Contains all content containers

### Userstories and sprints
I implemented userstories for every step of the frontend development of this project. The main project [can be viewed here.](https://github.com/users/andrewcargill/projects/8)

## Bugs

## Deployment

## Future Development
- Users can compare the powers of two superheros (along the line of top trumps)
- City Major login - They can reward superheros with money and also add posts that link to specific Superheros
- Public login - They can rate superheros and send fan-mail (direct messages to Superheros) 


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
